                            Working with Wendy Chou and Benjamin Winebrake, we collaborated with Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to explore the challenge of attracting new audience members and retaining existing patrons for traditional orchestras. Using market research techniques, we strategized a marketing plan aimed towards millennials to increase Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert-goers and revenue.

                                As classical music becomes more and more niche to younger generations, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra found a growing difficulty attracting new audience members and retaining existing users. The challenge was evident in Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s 2014-2015 season, where its difficulty to fill 2,662 seats met with a drop in overall ticket revenues of 4 percent. Sales for the flagship subscription series Mellon Grand Classics dropped 11 percent, and Pops concert series dropped 6 percent.

                                Since PSO’s current subscription model has a number of selections (Pops and Fuse) that are designed to compel younger generation, we identified two major target users for the project: millennials who enjoy classical concerts but do not have friends who have the same shared interests and students who are not particularly keen on going to classical music concerts but are willing to try something new.

                                Melissa is a 20 year old student studying biology at Carnegie Mellon University. Her hobbies include playing the violin and cooking. She used to frequent her local orchestra before she went to college, but has not had the chance to listen to a live orchestra since. She is a busy person who would love to make time to listen to an orchestra play, but planning with a friend to go with her last minute proves difficult because she does not know how much time to allocate for the concert specifically. Additionally, the transportation to and from downtown is long and infrequent.

                                These are the groups who are in their late teens to 20s, are in university for at least four years, have the purchasing power to decide where the budget for entertainment goes, and have a potential of introducing a large number of new patrons to Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. We wish to improve participation of these two major groups as they are the ever-changing group that may generate more publicity beyond four years of their time in university. At the same time, we wish to address the pain points this group faces of interests, price, time, and transportation.

                                We started this project wanting to understand the landscape Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra competed in. As a broad understanding that Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is in the entertainment business, we noted all those PSO had to compete with for the attention of millennials. Primary competitors included those directly entertaining with the arts, such as Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and movie theaters. Secondary competitors included other forms of entertainment, such as sports games.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the secondary research, we jotted down gaps in our knowledge that we wanted to address and clarify in our initial client meeting. Two major insights evolved:

                                    While Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra shares the entertainment stage with multiple drivers, PSO brands itself as providing high artistic excellence and quality to the community.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                    Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s marketing strategy is driven by targeted marketing through mail. This conscious decision is because its major audience, the Grand Classics series, is geared towards older demographic.

                                For our next step, we used our problem scope and specific insights to define our survey and interview experience. We asked questions to measure if the user’s understanding of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra matched with the one which PSO branded itself. We also asked questions to understand the process a user goes through to plan for different entertainment events. Each team member found two user participants to interview with. Using Google Forms, we created an online survey to collect 49 distinct results over the course of one night.

                                Analyzing all the qualitative and quantitative data we collected together, we drew specific marketing recommendations for our client to address three major problem components. In conjunction to the explanation of our solution, our original presentation is attached below.

                        </div> <!-- /end .reveal.center-align -->

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    To retain existing and attract new millennial subscribers, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra should make the program times transparent so that groups may create concrete plans. Additionally, Pops and FUSE concerts, which are most popular with millennials, should be promoted at least 3+ weeks prior to event through social media. Three weeks was the average time when people plan and take action to attend upcoming concerts.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    To attract younger audience through different channels, PSO should enhance its social media presence using their pamphlet promotional images. To unite and convey the branding as delivering high quality to its younger community, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra should opt to share the beautiful print promotional images on pamphlet online rather than use lackluster phone photos taken live.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    To build a tighter community, PSO should listen to its constituents. The younger generation is most concerned with music interests, so developing the Fuse concerts in addition to the Pops concert is a method to combine the classics and the modern pop. Many times, people plan to eat before the concert but find themselves having to rush dinner plans because of an awkward start time to the concert, so creating a package that includes pre-concert dinner will answer groups’ questions “What should we do for dinner?”. Personal contact with the musicians will also incentivize millennials to listen to PSO concerts, so we recommend PSO to create partnership events, such as meet-and-greet events with a musician or battle of the musicians, with CMU. PSO may take advantage beyond exposure and to sell tickets at these events.

                                While the time constraint made it so I was unable to personally implement the recommendations for Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to ideation, as of the 2016-2017 concert season, I was pleased to see that Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra has since used parts of our recommendations.

                                I am thankful that this opportunity taught me the importance of verifying information with the firsthand user. Because messages may be lost in translation part way, miscommunication triggers become an opportunity for me to provide a marketing or design solution. Moving forward to future projects, I will learn to interact with each stakeholder to verify beliefs and understanding.
