                        <p>
                            For this assignment, I was tasked to explore opportunities to bring back a personâ€™s perceptual-motor skills and the sensory nature of the bodies and redesign a control experience in two weeks. I chose to reimagine the shower control and design it as a physical point of interaction that communicats perceptual affordance, feedforward, and feedback.

                        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                        <div>
                            <img class="responsive-img materialboxed" src="assets/shower-control/shower-control-problem-1.jpg" alt="shower control problem 1">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            At the beginning of every shower, users turn their shower control from off to the warmest setting for at least 30 seconds before stepping into the water. Waiting before testing the water temperature is a shared trait among so many people that 30 percent of the water used to shower is wasted on waiting for the water to warm.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="responsive-img materialboxed" src="assets/shower-control/shower-control-problem-2.jpg" alt="shower control problem 2">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This unquestioned waiting time and action to turn the shower to the highest setting in the beginning is because the only immediate feedback users receive from playing with the control signifier is the on and off of the water. There is a lack of feedback of the temperature and pressure when the water is first turned on.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Final Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Shower control designs fill three basic shower needs: turning on/off the water, changing the temperature, and changing the pressure. With current shower controls, residents waste an average of 30 percent of water per shower just waiting for the water to heat up. To challenge current control settings so that residents practice water saving habits without having to consciously form those habits, this shower control design taps into what users are already familiar with.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="responsive-img materialboxed" src="assets/shower-control/shower-control-final-1.jpg" alt="shower control redesign temperature">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Most immediate to the user is the setting of the temperature by dial. It is designed to be the frontmost option to signal to the user that the first step to using the shower is to set the temperature. It is written with concrete temperature labels by degrees of 10 degrees Fahrenheit (or roughly 5 degrees Celsius), coupled with the red/blue labels for hot/cold like the generic shower control. The temperature label is designed concretely so that once the user knows what temperature is the most comfortable, the user would always set their shower to that exact temperature or leave it at the same placement.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="responsive-img materialboxed" src="assets/shower-control/shower-control-final-2.jpg" alt="shower control redesign on/off">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The next step of action for the user is to press on the shower control, like you would a button, to turn on the shower. Once the water is on, the user may still adjust the temperature of the water if necessary, usually to a colder temperature.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="responsive-img materialboxed" src="assets/shower-control/shower-control-final-3.jpg" alt="shower control pressure">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            An option for the user is to change the pressure of the water flow by twisting the shower control left or right. As users use their showers for the purpose of showering their whole bodies, the pressure of the water may be adjusted to the max and stay at the max. However, some users may use their showers to only wash their feet from time to time, and that would only need a medium or low pressure. The user would then turn the shower control from the max (most left) rightwards so that the pressure of the water turns to medium or low. The same idea works to adjust the water to a higher pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the shower is complete, the user only has to press the shower control again, and the water supply will shut off.
                        </p>
